This code can plot surface deformation and a few point time-series, for a
reasonably large set of selected events.

To work with it, edit the [plot_parameters.R](plot_parameters.R), then source
the [earthquake_types_plot.R](earthquake_types_plot.R). Once that has been run
you can source the [plot_stage_time_series.R](plot_stage_time_series.R) script.

Beware details of this code might need adjusting for any particular case - it
is not yet perfectly generic.
