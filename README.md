Codes for probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment. 

The main codes and README information reside in the folder [R](R). This
includes the R package [rptha](R/rptha).

The folder [propagation](propagation) contains a linear shallow water equations solver.

The folder [ptha_access](ptha_access) contains scripts to download the PTHA
results (or more typically, subsets thereof, since the full analysis is TB in
size).
