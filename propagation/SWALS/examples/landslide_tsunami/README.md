This test case is `Benchmark Problem 1' from the `Third International workshop
on long-wave runup models, June 17-18 2004'. It models the runup of an initial
waveform on a linearly sloping beach. The analytical solution was produced
using the techniques of Carrier, Wu and Yeh (2003). The problem descriptions
and solution were sourced from http://isec.nacse.org/workshop/2004\_cornell/bmark1.html
