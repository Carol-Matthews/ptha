The runup around the conical island experiment is reported by Briggs et al.
(1995), although not all details are included. These results of this experiment
are reported in various other papers, but there is some inconsistency in the
island runup values.
- The Briggs et al. (1995) runup results are reported by Liu et al (1995) in
  terms of "R/A" where R is runup (cm), and A is a target wave amplitude (0.016
  cm for Case A, 0.032 cm for Case B, 0.064 cm for Case C). These same results
  are reported in tabular form in Ma et al. (2019), and Choi et al. (2007)
    - All these studies compare this version of the observations with models -
      the former a nonlinear shallow water model, and the latter 2 studies
      various 3d models -- and their models seem to agree with the data quite well. 
- The Briggs et al. (1995) runup results are also reported in the NTHMP test
  repository {https://github.com/rjleveque/tsunami_benchmarks}, and graphically
  in Synolakis et al (2007) and the NTHMP report
    - But the runup turns out to be quite different, especially for Case A. For instance,
      the maximal case A runup is about 1cm lower all around the island, as compared
      with the Liu/Ma version
    - Confusingly, for this version of the data we also see reasonably good model-vs-data comparisons!
    - When I convergence test my shallow water models, I seem to get closer to
      the Liu/Choi/Ma version than the NTHMP version.
