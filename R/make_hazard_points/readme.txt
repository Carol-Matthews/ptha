Here are some scripts for making hazard points. They are not in 'package' form, and they rely on input datasets which are not provided here.

Key code is:

make_hazard_pts.R -- for automatically making hazard points
contour_util.R -- useful GIS functions
country_area_check.R -- check on area of countries (used when preparing ISLAND_CLIP_LAYER so we don't cut out small island states)
