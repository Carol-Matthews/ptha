# **Making unit sources from contours defining the earthquake source geometry**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Note: Do not edit the tutorial.md file directly, as it is auto-generated by the
corresponding tutorial.Rmd file. Edit the latter instead.*

# Background

This document explains how to use the script
*'[produce_unit_sources.R](produce_unit_sources.R)'* to convert earthquake
source contours (defining an irregularly dipping surface on which earthquake
slip can occur) into tsunami unit sources. 

You may find it helpful to directly read
*'[produce_unit_sources.R](produce_unit_sources.R)'* first (or instead),
particularly if you have programming experience. All functions used therein are
documented in the rptha package or other packages, and so R's help system can
be consulted for details. 

In a typical application you would make a copy of
*'[produce_unit_sources.R](produce_unit_sources.R)'* in a new working
directory, and then edit the script parameters as required before running. You
might also edit the code, depending on your needs.

To create a set of unit sources, you first need to have a set of source
contours. These describe the earthquake source geometry, which we will
discretize into unit sources. The source contours need to be in line shapefile
format, where each line corresponds to a contour with given depth. The actual
depths are stored in the shapefile attribute table, with an attribute name
'level' giving the depth in km.  Lon-lat coordinates should be used (WGS84).

The source contours will be used to define the unit sources, so they should
only cover areas where you want unit sources to be made. On a typical
subduction zone they would extend from the subduction zone trench to a depth
of around 50 km, though the latter depth may vary (see e.g.  Berryman et al.,
2015). 

The unit sources will be arranged in a logically rectangular grid which covers
the source contours. The number of unit-sources down-dip and along-strike is chosen
based on the user-provided value for the desired unit-source length and width. 

# Example data

In this example we work with some contours for the Alaska source-zone. This is
situated at the eastern end of the Aleutians-Alaska subduction interface in the
North Pacific. The code below demonstrates how to read them in R and make a basic plot. 

**Note the code in this section is not required when using
*'[produce_unit_sources.R](produce_unit_sources.R)'* -- however, we include
this to demonstrate the input data requirements**

# Input parameters

The code below comes directly from
*'[produce_unit_sources.R](produce_unit_sources.R)'*.

In typical usage of *'[produce_unit_sources.R](produce_unit_sources.R)'*, the
user would edit the input parameters to define the source contour filename(s),
the assumed earthquake rake, the desired unit-source length and width, the
resolution of the output raster, and some numerical parameters, the most
important of which are the sub-unit-source grid spacing.

If Kajiura filtering is to be applied, then the user must also provide an
elevation raster (in lon-lat coordinates, with elevation in m, and negative
value being below MSL). The input source zones should of course have longitudes
inside the extent of the raster (if they are off by 360 degrees then the code
will make the correction). Use of Kajiura filtering will cause the code to run
more slowly.

Note that more than one source-contour shapefile can be provided -- the code
will loop over them.

If you are running linux on a shared memory machine with multiple cores, then
you can run in parallel by setting MC_CORES to be a number greater than one. In
this case each core will run separate unit sources, until all are completed.

# Desired spacing of sub-unit-source points
# Lower values (e.g. 1000) may be required for accuracy in unit sources
# near the trench, because shallow deformation tends to be quite localised.
# For deeper unit sources, a much coarser point spacing can be used without
# sacrificing accuracy. 
# Hence we use different values for the 'shallow' sub-unit-source points (i.e.
# < 50km down dip) and the deeper ones.
# The computational effort approximately scales with the inverse square of
# the point density. 
shallow_subunitsource_point_spacing = 1000 # m
deep_subunitsource_point_spacing = 6000 #m

# For computational efficiency, only compute the okada deformation at
# distances <= okada_distance_factor x (depth of sub-unit-source point) 
# This can save computational effort for shallow unit sources.
# But be careful if using a wide subunitsource_point_spacing.
okada_distance_factor = 20 # Inf 

# elevation raster (required for Kajiura filtering). Should give elevation in m, 
# with the ocean having elevation < 0. Should have a lon/lat spatial projection. 
# Set to NULL to not use Kajiura filtering.
elevation_raster = NULL 
## A realistic example would look like:
#elevation_raster = raster('../../../../DATA/ELEV/GEBCO_08/gebco_08.nc')
## Note that for Kajiura filtering, a minimum depth of 10m will be assumed 
## (to avoid passing negative depths to the Kajiura smoothing routine)

# For computational efficiency, only apply Kajiura filtering in a box
# containing all points where the unit source deformation exceeds
# kajiura_use_threshold. Set to zero to apply Kajiura filter everywhere.
#
# Use of a small positive number can be faster.
# Since the unit sources have 1m slip, use of e.g. 1e-03 suggests an
# error of < 1cm to the free surface, even if the slip were 10m. 
# In practice there might be greater difference because our Kajiura routine
# involves interpolation to/from cartesian coordinates. Interpolation creates
# slight diffusion, and changes to the Kajiura box will affect the
# interpolation and so also affect this, though not in a systematic way.
kajiura_use_threshold = 1.0e-03

# When applying the kajiura filter, the data is regridded onto a grid with
# spacing=kajiura_gridspacing. The latter should be small compared to the
# horizontal distance over which the free surface deformation changes
# significantly (and small compared with the distance of
# tsunami_source_cellsize). If this is not small enough, artefacts
# can be observed especially when summing tsunami sources.
# A numerically easier alternative is to apply kajiura AFTER summing
# the sources [see script in 'combine_tsunami_sources' folder]
kajiura_grid_spacing = 2000 # m

# Cell size for output rasters
# The computation time will scale inversely with tsunami_source_cellsize^2
# Here we use a relatively coarse discretization, for demonstration purposes

# Option to reduce the size of RDS output
# TRUE should be fine for typical usage

# Option to make the unit-source edges be more orthogonal to the trench. TRUE
# can help if artefacts in the solution near the trench occur. 
orthogonal_near_trench = FALSE
```

# Running the script
Assuming the rptha package has been successfully installed, the script can be
run from within R using the syntax:

    source('produce_unit_sources.R', echo=TRUE, max.deparse.length=Inf)

where the `echo=TRUE` command prints the commands to the screen as they are
executed. 

Alternatively the script can be run from the commandline directly with:

    Rscript produce_unit_sources.R

To only run a single shapefile, you can pass an integer argument, e.g.:

    Rscript produce_unit_sources.R 10

The above command would run the 10th shapefile from within CONTOURS (assuming
alphabetical ordering).  The main purpose of this option is to facilitate
running each sourcezone separately in a HPC environment (since it is relatively
easy to automatically submit many jobs with different integer arguments).

In either case the working directory must be the directory containing
*'[produce_unit_sources.R](produce_unit_sources.R)'*.

The speed of the code depends heavily on a number of input parameters. If it is too
slow, you can try decreasing the `tsunami_source_cellsize`. More dangerously
you can try increasing the subunitsource_point_spacing parameters, or
increasing the `kajiura_grid_spacing` (the latter only matters if you provide
elevation data). But if the parameters in the last sentence are too coarse
you can expect numerical artefacts.


# Outputs

If the code successfully runs, it will generate: 
* a set of tiff files (one for each unit source) with the computed tsunami
deformation for each unit source (assuming 1m of earthquake slip).
* a pdf file for each source zone, with various plots that can be used to check
that the unit sources and tsunami deformations seem sensible.
* an RDS file for each unit source. This is a native R format file, and contains
the tsunami unit sources as a native R data-structure. It can be useful for
programming and debugging, since it contains the underlying data (such as
sub-unit-source points, exact unit source discretization, etc).

# Tips
Beware of possible artefacts in the computed solution along the trench when
rupture becomes very shallow and the source zone is nonuniform. In our
experience this is not detectable when Kajiura filtering is applied. In general
we suggest to always apply Kajiura filtering. It is not done above so we can
avoid distributing elevation data with the package, and also because often it
is best to apply Kajiura filtering AFTER unit sources have been combined (see
next paragraph).

If a fine unit source spacing is used and the unit source deformations are combined
to produce tsunami initial conditions, then it may be best to apply Kajiura filtering
AFTER combining the sources ('filtering-after-combining'). Mathematically the
problem is linear, and there should be no difference between this and
filtering-before-combining (i.e. filtering before the unit source deformations
are combined, as supported in this script). However, in practice our Kajiura
filtering algorithm involves some interplation, leading to some discretization
error, and the approach of 'filtering-before-combining' is numerically much
more sensitive to this than 'filtering-after-combining'. In the
filtering-before-combining approach, individual unit source deformations can
have steep gradients that would be cancelled by neighbouring sources after
combination. These steep gradients cause relatively high smoothing with the
Kajiura filter. To avoid artefacts any discretization errors in this
smoothing must cancel with those from neighbouring unit source deformations. In
practice it is difficult to achieve this, whereas by definition it is not an
issue for the filtering-after-combining approach.
