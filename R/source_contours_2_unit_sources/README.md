The code *'produce_unit_sources.R'* gives an example of:

1) Making a discretized source from some source contours

2) Making tsunami unit sources for each unit source in the discretized source

The last part of the code makes a 3D interactive plot (supports zoom, pan, rotate), like in this screenshot.
![planview](ThreeD_plot.png?raw=true). Note that the high ridge of deformation
is caused by the slip abruptly changing from 1m to 0m above a depth of 6km.
