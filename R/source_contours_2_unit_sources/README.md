The code **'[produce_unit_sources.R](produce_unit_sources.R)'** gives an example of:

1) Making a discretized source from some source contours

2) Making tsunami unit sources for each unit source in the discretized source

For more information on its usage, click on the **'[tutorial.md](tutorial.md)'** file.

The last part of the code can be used to makes a 3D interactive plot (supports
zoom, pan, rotate), like in the screenshot below.  Note that the high ridge of
deformation is caused by the slip abruptly changing from 1m to 0m above a depth
of 6km.
