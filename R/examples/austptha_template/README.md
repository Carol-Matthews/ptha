./DATA contains data that has been 'processed' or developed for modelling
  [e.g. sourcezone contours, edited DEMs, etc]. It should not contain RAW data,
  (the latter instead goes in '../../DATA/')

./SOURCE_ZONES contains unit source initial conditions and tsunami runs for
  every source-zone. This is the bulk of our modelling results.
