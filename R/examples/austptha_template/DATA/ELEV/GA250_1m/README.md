Script to down-sample GA250 elevation data
------------------------------------------

To use it, modify [downsample_GA250.sh](downsample_GA250.sh) to point to the
GA250 data, and then do:
    
    source downsample_ga250.sh

**Note that this script is not directly used when making the merged DEM for our tsunami model**
since similar operations are performed elsewhere. However, it can be a useful thing to do.
