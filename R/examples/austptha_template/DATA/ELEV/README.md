Scripts to re-sample versions of GEBCO and GA250m data, and make a merged DEM.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The actual data files are not provided here (since they are very large!) but the
scripts used to process them are included.

To make the merged DEM, follow the instruction in the README of [merged_dem](merged_dem).
This will require running some scripts in [GEBCO_2014_1m](GEBCO_2014_1m) as well.

For other purposes, you should also make downsampled GA250 data using the script in
[GA250_1m](GA250_1m).
