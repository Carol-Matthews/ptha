[single_source_rate_computation.R](single_source_rate_computation.R)
illustrates computation of the Mw-exceedance-rate curve on a single
source-zone. This is the best script to examine to learn how to use those
functions.

compute_rates_all_sources.R is a generalisation of the above techniques for
'batch' computation of the rate for each earthquake/tsunami event, on every
sourcezone. It has hard-coded parameters and is currently just for
demonstration.
