This folder contains info to guide installation of rptha on NCI:
* package_installs.R -- script + explanation on how to install dependencies for rptha package. This is surprisingly hard. BE SURE TO READ THE COMMENTS, if you just run the script it will fail.
* R_modules.sh -- A file containing NCI modules to source before building or using the rptha package. It is discussed in package_installs.R
* ./.R -- a 'hidden' directory that you should copy to your home directory before installing packages

All of this was up to date as of October 2016, but might plausibly evolve over time as default modules change on NCI.
